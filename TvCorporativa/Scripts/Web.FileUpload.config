<!-- Configurations for the FileUpload handler 
    // Remarks: The server side FileUpload handler supports very fine granulated and complex storage structures (folders and database tables).
    // These storage structures can be influenced server and client side. On the server side you can set up root folders (web.config), on the client you set up context specific subfolders (see example below).
    // The good thing: You do not have to use all this stuff. Just omit these settings to use the default simple and flat structure. Everything is stored withing the ~/files folder by default.
    // Client side parameters: objectContext and uploadContext (see Example):
    // The parameters objectContext and uploadContext are optional. You do not have to include them in the get request.
    // Basically they influence the storage location on the server, regardless if it is a database or folder structure.
    // Server side settings: filesRoot, objectsRoot and content type specific subfolders:
    // filesRoot is the root folder for all uploads. objectsRoot is a subfolder an can be ommitted if you do not need it.
    // Set up content type specific sub folders, if you want to filter and store files of a specific content into seperate subfolders. Example: Store images into an images subfolder (content-types: images/jpeg, images/png, etc. typeFragment: images/). See also example in the contentTypes section.
    // Example:
    // You want to set up an artist library were users are able to store content (songs, images, videos, other files).
    // You want to store the different content in seperate subfolders of a root artist folder, where any content belonging to this specific artist is stored.
    // Your servers folder structure: [filesRoot]/[objectsRoot]/[objectContext]/[uploadContext] (e.g. ~/files/artists/michealjackson/videos) where [filesRoot] and [objectsRoot] are set up server side in the web.config.
    // The objectContext will be the artist. It must be a unique name (e.g. michealjackson) or id. Any uploaded files related to this artist will be stored within a location of this unique id or name.
    // UploadContext values are the different content types in this example (e.g. songs, images, videos, other) and result into a subfolder or different datatable. 
    // If you use seperate JQuery file upload controls for the different content, you can simply include hidden input fields. The client JQuery File Upload control will automatically transmit hidden input files to the server. But if you manually perform a ajax request (as in this example), you have to set these parametes by hand. 
    // objectContext, uploadContext and fileName can be send in the url (get, delete requwat) or in the body (post, put request).
    // Note: The subfolder structure can be even more complex: uploadContext supports subfolders within subfolders (e.g. /songs/mp3, /songs/wav, etc.). Simply seperate the subfolders by semicolon. Use this example pattern as the value of uploadContext: value="songs;mp3" or value="songs;wav". 
    // Note: You can also set up a content type specific subfoldering on the server within the web.config.

There are several ways set up subfolders, e.g. uploadContext and objectContext) [Default: "false"]

      allowDelete:      // Set to "false" if deletion of uploaded files should be not possible [Default: "true"]
      deleteHandler:    // By default (deleteHandler="") the FileUploadHandler handles incoming delete requests.
